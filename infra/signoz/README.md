# SigNoz Dashboards and Alerts

These assets are designed for the telemetry emitted by this repository:

- backend service name: `site-backend`
- frontend service name: `site-frontend`
- frontend browser ingestion path: `POST /otel/v1/traces`

If you changed `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` or `FRONTEND_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_NAME`,
replace those service names in the JSON manifests before importing.

## Dashboards

Import the JSON files from `infra/signoz/dashboards/` in the SigNoz UI.

1. Open SigNoz.
2. Go to `Dashboards`.
3. Choose the import option in the dashboard UI.
4. Import:
   - `site-unified-operations.json`
   - `site-backend-overview.json`
   - `site-frontend-telemetry.json`

What they cover:

- `site-unified-operations.json`
  - single operational view for backend traffic, backend latency and errors
  - frontend span throughput, latency, and error ratio
  - contact outcomes, notification outcomes, and OTLP proxy health
- `site-backend-overview.json`
  - request rate and request breakdowns by method, status, and top route
  - p95 latency overall and by path
  - 4xx ratio, 5xx ratio, in-flight requests
  - contact submission outcomes and degraded delivery ratio
  - notification outcomes, per-channel latency, and OTLP proxy health
- `site-frontend-telemetry.json`
  - frontend span throughput and p95 latency by operation
  - error ratio, errored operations, and span-kind breakdown
  - page lifecycle spans, user interaction events, and contact form client flow
  - top operations plus OTLP proxy traffic, latency, and 5xx ratio

## Alerts

The alert manifests under `infra/signoz/alerts/` are ready for the
`/api/v1/rules` endpoint, but they intentionally use the placeholder channel
name `__REPLACE_WITH_SIGNOZ_CHANNEL__`.

Use an existing SigNoz notification channel name when importing.

Example import loop:

```bash
export SIGNOZ_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
export SIGNOZ_API_TOKEN=<your-signoz-api-token>
export SIGNOZ_CHANNEL=<existing-signoz-channel-name>

for rule in infra/signoz/alerts/*.json; do
  jq --arg channel "$SIGNOZ_CHANNEL" \
    '(.condition.thresholds.spec[]?.channels) |= [$channel]' \
    "$rule" \
    | curl -sS \
        -X POST "$SIGNOZ_BASE_URL/api/v1/rules" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SIGNOZ_API_TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data-binary @-
done
```

Included rules:

- `backend-high-5xx-rate.json`
- `backend-high-p95-latency.json`
- `backend-notification-high-p95-latency.json`
- `contact-delivery-degraded.json`
- `frontend-document-load-high-p95-latency.json`
- `frontend-high-error-rate.json`
- `frontend-otlp-proxy-failures.json`

## Signal assumptions

Backend metrics come from the app meter:

- `site.http.server.request.count`
- `site.http.server.request.duration`
- `site.http.server.active_requests`
- `site.contact.submission.count`
- `site.contact.notification.count`
- `site.contact.notification.duration`

Frontend panels and alerts use SigNoz trace-derived metrics:

- `signoz_calls_total`
- `signoz_latency.bucket`

For SigNoz `v0.112.x`, the imported frontend dashboard and alert manifests use
the normalized PromQL label aliases (`service_name`, `status_code`) for these
derived metrics, even though trace views display attributes as `service.name`
and `status.code`.

The OTLP proxy panels and alerts use backend request metrics filtered on:

- `path="/otel/v1/traces"`
